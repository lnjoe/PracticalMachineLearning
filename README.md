Use the link https://lnjoe.github.io/PracticalMachineLearning/index.html to see my index.html file rendered correctly as html.  

I am not sure why the file will not render correctly.  I followed the instruction set for gh-pages from https://github.com/lgreski/datasciencectacontent/blob/master/markdown/pml-ghPagesSetup.md . The Closing Considerations section at the bottom of the instructions provided the workaround I have above.  I hope this helps.
